TCAs without major CYP2C19 metabolism include the secondary amines nortriptyline and desipramine. For tertiary amines, consider a 50% reduction of the recommended starting dose. Utilize therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustments. Titrate dose to observed clinical response with symptom improvement and minimal (if any) side effects.",
